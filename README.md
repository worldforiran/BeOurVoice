## A brief history of Iran

Some of you might know Iran as the great Persia, here we want to shortly narrate the story of our beloved country. In 1979 a revolution happened in Iran. At that time people considered this revolution to be a ray of hope for more freedom and justice. However, as time passed by this revolution gave people nothing more than despair, bullets and violence.

## Islamic republic of Iran vs. people of Iran

Soon the Islamic regime became not only the enemy of people, but also their main source of suffocation. After mandating hijab in Iran, many women became victims of this new regulation. Some were murdered and some were taken to jail and tortured to the level of death.
The activists who rose against the brutal violence of the government and mandatory hijab were immediately arrested, some of which were threatened and were forced to fake confessions, such as Sepideh Rashno. In her interview with the national media of Iran traces of torture and significant changes in her face were clear to the people.

But this is not where the never-ending massive crimes of Islamic Republic ends. In 2020 the government of Iran bombarded the civilians that boarded on PS752 to fly to Ukraine. 175 people died, among them was Reera, 9 years old.

## What kind of social movement is going on in Iran?

The people of Iran are not silent anymore. They are rising against the Islamic regime and are demanding their rights. They are demanding freedom, justice and equality. They are demanding the end of the Islamic regime.

On 16th of September 2022 the morality police beat a girl named Mahsa Amini to the point of coma. Three days after she went into a coma she passed away. Iranian people could not tolerate the brutal deaths of girls of their motherland anymore.
As one of the rarest social phenomena, especially in the Middle East, men and women came together for women’s rights. Protests all over Iran began for Mahsa Amini. Now in all cities of  Iran people are fighting against the armed forces of the government empty-handed. Even massive murders of peaceful protestors did not stop Iranian people, as the value of freedom, justice and equality is more than their lives for them. Women and men are dying in Iran, in the hope of the death of dictatorship.

## What happens if Iranian people win this protest?

The government of Iran has significant impacts on Middle Eastern countries and it has caused chaos in countries like Afghanistan by arming and financially supporting many terrorist groups.

History repeats itself. The French revolution might not be the only revolution that caused revolution in other countries. This time it can be the revolution of Iran that encourages Middle Eastern people to to fight for women's and human rights!
Let’s end this together!
